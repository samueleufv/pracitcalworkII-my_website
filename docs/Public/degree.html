        <h2>Program Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Computer engineering program is structured across four years, each building upon the previous <br>
             to create a comprehensive understanding of both hardware and software aspects of computing.<br>
             The curriculum combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications through laboratory work and projects.<br>  
            The program is structured to provide a strong foundational knowledge during the first two years, <br>
            with a broad focus on mathematics, physics, and introductory computer science concepts. <br>
             This ensures a solid base for understanding more specialized topics.<br>
              The final two years, however, are more sector-focused, diving deeply into fields like artificial intelligence,<br>
               machine learning, and network security. This progression allows students to gradually build expertise while <br>
               exploring advanced and practical aspects of their discipline.
