       <h2>SUBJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>

       <p>
        "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both academic and professional points of view. 
        The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which his engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), 
        the future professional careers and the role of a computer engineer in today's society.
        The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps develop practical skills.

        The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content. <br>
        1- Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer Engineering. 
        Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological and ethical foundations. <br>
        2- Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information. <br>
        3- Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in computer systems and applications. <br>
        The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction 
        to web development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page 
        on contents related to the course.

Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development basic soft-skills for an engineer, 
such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and written, of technical information, 
favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational project of the University.

      <h2>GOALS</h2>
<p>The specific objectives of this course are designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the field of Computer Engineering: <br>
    -Grasp the essential objectives of Computer Engineering, its ultimate goals, and the value it brings to society, 
    while contemplating the role you aspire to play as an engineer in the future. <br>
    -Gain knowledge of the fundamental principles upon which technological progress should be based, 
    with an initial historical perspective on technological development. <br>
    -Recognize the importance of the human element in professional practice and cultivate a commitment to service and contributing to the common good. <br>
    -Achieve a global vision of the field, understand its various areas of knowledge, 
    and identify different career paths and professional profiles to begin questioning your own vocational calling. <br>
    -Acquire knowledge about current paradigms, trends in computing, data management, and an introduction to web development.
