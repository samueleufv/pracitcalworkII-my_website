        <h2 class="welcome-title">WHO I AM </h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Engineering student from Italy. This is my last year of university. I really like my faculty because
            I think it's very entertaining and intriguing.
            I decided to attend a Computer Engineering course because because I was very curious about this field and because it offers very good job prospects.
            In these years I have learnt many things about this world, especially about theory.
            I have developed a strong passion for bioinformatics, a field that captivates me with its fusion of biology and technology. 
            My interest in this discipline was inspired by my father, a biologist, whose work and dedication have been a great source of inspiration. 
            I hope to pursue bioinformatics as my future field of study or career.
